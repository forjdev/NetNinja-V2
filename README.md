There's also proxy support to prevent IP blocking or improve performance, and it can handle dynamic content on even the most complex websites.

Overall, our web crawling script is a reliable and user-friendly tool that can help you get the data you need with minimal hassle.

## What happened to version 1?
Unfortunately, due to human error, the first version of our web crawling script was completely destroyed. This means that all the code and data related to the first version of the script were lost and cannot be recovered.

This is a significant setback for us, as we put a lot of time and effort into developing the initial version of the script. However, we understand that mistakes happen, and we're taking steps to prevent this from happening again in the future.

Moving forward, we'll be implementing more robust backup and version control systems to protect against human error or other unforeseen circumstances that could cause data loss. We'll also be conducting more frequent backups to ensure that we have up-to-date copies of all our code and data.

We understand that the loss of the first version of our script may be inconvenient for our users, and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. We're committed to making things right and ensuring that we provide our users with the best possible experience moving forward.
